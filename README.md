# Mobile Checker

The Mobile Checker is a tool for Web developers who want to make their Web page or Web app work better on mobile devices.

## Installation

Mobile Checker is a Node application. It will eventually be distributed through npm, but in the meantime
you can simply clone this repository and run:

    npm install -d

In order to get all the dependencies installed. Naturally, this requires that you have a reasonably
recent version of Node installed.

This application require [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org).

## Running

In the repository run :

    node app.js

Connect on the localhost:3000 port.

## Testing

coming soon...
