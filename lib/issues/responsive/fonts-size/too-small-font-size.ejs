    <h2 class="title-issue">too small font size detected</h2>
        <p>element <%=htmlTag%> detected with font-size lower than 16px.</p>
        <h3>why ?</h3>
        <p>On a mobile device, it's recommended to not put font-size lower than 16px because the user experience will be deteriorated with small font size. It could force user to zoom on their mobile device.</p>
        <h3>how fix it ?</h3>
        <p>It's recommened to put font-size power than 16px. 18px is cool for paragraph on a mobile device.</p>
