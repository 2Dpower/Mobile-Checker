    <h2 class="title-issue">Users are prevented to zoom</h2>
        <p>The meta viewport declaration prevents users to zoom in on the page.</p>
        <h3>why ?</h3>
        <p>Except in some specific cases (e.g. games), preventing users to zoom in a page is discouraged; users may want to see details in an image, or may have trouble reading at the current zoom level.</p>
        <h3>how to fix it ?</h3>
